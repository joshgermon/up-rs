# Up.rs

###  A simple CLI tool for interacting with the Up Bank API with your own personal token written in Rust.

Reason for this tool being created is to be able to generate different transaction records for your personal accounts such as a CSV to open in excel and to be able to use for personal finance and budgeting purposes.

Completely unofficial and not associated with Up in any way.
